<p>This is the third mission in the series about the game riichi mahjong. This mission is more difficult than the previous ones, so be prepared.</p>

<p>This time, your task is to determine which is the smallest number of tiles in the hand you need to replace in order to make it a winning one. In other words, it is necessary to determine its so-called shanten number. Remember that there is not only the standard "four sets and a pair" hand pattern, but also chitoitsu and kokushi-muso.</p>

<p>For simplicity, the possibility of open sets is omitted. However, you should thoroughly check the input data and, if it is invalid, return None.</p>

<p>Here are the explanatory examples:</p>

<p>In the next hand, you need to replace only one tile ("tempai"):</p>

<pre class="brush: python">['p4', 'p5', 'p6', 'm1', 'm1', 'm1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 'we', 'we', 'dw', 'dw']</pre>

<p>And this one has three tiles to replace:</p>

<pre class="brush: python">['p4', 'p5', 'p6', 'm1', 'm1', 'm1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's6', 'we', 'ws', 'dw', 'dw']</pre>

<p>
    <strong>Input data: </strong> One argument â€” a list of strings encoding tiles.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output data: </strong> An int type variable: the number of shanten in the hand.
</p>

<p> 
    <strong>Example: </strong>
</p>
<pre class="brush: python">
    riichi_mahjong_shanten(['p4', 'p5', 'p6', 'm1', 'm1', 'm1', 's2', 's3', 's4', 's5', 'we', 'we', 'dw', 'dw']) == 1
</pre>
